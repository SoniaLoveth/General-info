        The University of Benin Teaching Hospital was taken over by the Federal
        Government on April 1st, 1975 as the fifth teaching hospital coming
        after Ibadan Teaching Hospital and Lagos Teaching Hospital.

        arise, to the extent that the UBTH could boastfully say that it has
        effectively discharged its Mandate.

      <p>
        For over forty years now, the Tertiary Referral Hospital, widely
        acknowledged as a Centre of Excellence, has remarkably and effectively
        served as the last port of call for expert management of diverse and
        varied disease conditions in Edo, Delta, part of Kogi and Ondo state
        which largely form its catchment area and sometimes further away.
