        The University of Benin Teaching Hospital was taken over by the Federal
        Government on April 1st, 1975 as the fifth teaching hospital coming
        after Ibadan Teaching Hospital and Lagos Teaching Hospital.</p> 
        <p>The Institution has been decisively responding to challenges as they arise,
        to the extent that the UBTH could boastfully say that it has effectively
        discharged its Mandate.</p> 
        <p>For over forty years now, the Tertiary Referral
        Hospital, widely acknowledged as a Centre of Excellence, has remarkably
        and effectively served as the last port of call for expert management of
        diverse and varied disease conditions in Edo, Delta, part of Kogi and
        Ondo state which largely form its catchment area and sometimes further
        away.</p>
